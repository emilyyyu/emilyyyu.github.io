In autumn 2025, I will join Leiden University in the Netherlands as an Assistant Professor and look forward to starting my own research group.

Since September 2023, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in <a href='https://pub.ista.ac.at/group_henzinger/'>Prof. Thomas Henzinger</a>’s group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. I received my PhD in the doctoral program ‘Logical Methods in Computer Science’ (LogiCS) funded by FWF, and the LIT AI Lab under the supervision of <a href='https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/biere/'>Prof. Armin Biere</a>, at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria. My thesis was on hardware model checking certification. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, UK, where I was advised by <a href='https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~alessio/index.html'>Prof. Alessio Lomuscio</a>.

My research focuses on formal verification and runtime monitoring for complex safety-critical systems, with a particular emphasis on integrating automated reasoning methodologies into learning neural-based control, and hardware systems. 

My current research interests include:

1. **System Verification**
 - Model checking and certification techniques
 - Hardware verification using SAT-based methods
 - Formal reasoning in multi-agent systems

2. **Trustworthy AI and Safe Autonomy**
  - Runtime monitoring for learning-enabled systems
  - Formal verification of neural policies and certificates

3. **Neural Network Verification**
  - Theoretical and practical analysis of neural networks in isolation

**I am looking to recruit Ph.D. students!** If you are interested in doing a PhD with me, feel free to reach out.
