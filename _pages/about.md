Since September 2023, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in <a href='https://pub.ista.ac.at/group_henzinger/'>Prof. Thomas Henzinger</a>’s group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. I received my PhD in the doctoral program ‘Logical Methods in Computer Science’ (LogiCS) funded by FWF, and the LIT AI Lab under the supervision of <a href='https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/biere/'>Prof. Armin Biere</a>, at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria. My thesis was on hardware model checking certification. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, UK, where I was advised by <a href='https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~alessio/index.html'>Prof. Alessio Lomuscio</a>.

My research focuses on **formal verification** and **runtime monitoring** for complex safety-critical systems, with a particular emphasis on integrating automated reasoning methodologies into learning neural-based control, and hardware systems. Recently, I also work on verification of neural networks.

My goal is to advance *trusted automated reasoning* in verification—from developing rigorous certifying methodologies to integrating runtime monitors and predictive analysis. If you’re interested in how to make machine learning systems verifiably safe, or formally proving the correctness of hardware designs, you’re in the right place.
